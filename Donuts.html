<h1 style="color: palevioletred;font-size:xx-large;">Ingredients:</h1>
<ul><li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</li>
    <li>¼ cup warm water (105 to 115 degrees)</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm milk</li>
<li>½ cup white sugar</li>
<li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>
<li> 2 eggs</li>
<li> ⅓ cup shortening</li>
<li> 5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
<li> 1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
<li> ⅓ cup butter</li>
<li> 2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
<li> 1 ½ teaspoons vanilla</li>
<li> 4 tablespoons hot water or as needed</li></ul>
<br><br><br>

<h1 style="color: palevioletred;font-size:xx-large;">Directions:</h1>
<pre><ol>
<li style="font-size: larger;">Sprinkle the yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.</li>
<li style="font-size: larger;">In a large bowl, mix together the yeast mixture, milk, sugar, salt, eggs, shortening, 
and 2 cups of the flour. Mix for a few minutes at low speed, or stirring with a wooden spoon.Beat in remaining flour 
1/2 cup at a time, until the dough no longer sticks to the bowl. Knead for about 5 minutes, or until smooth and elastic. 
Place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Set in a warm place to rise until double. Dough is ready if you touch it, 
and the indention remains.</li>
<li style="font-size: larger;">Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. 
Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit out to rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth.</li>
<li style="font-size: larger;">Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth.
Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Set aside.</li>
<li style="font-size: larger;">Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. 
Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. 
Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. 
Keep a cookie sheet or tray under racks for easier clean up.</li>
